# DjangoDataAnalysis
This is a data analysis project using Python Django framework. I'm collecting users review (basically surveying) for products on behalf of product company. I (Aditya Jain) developed this as my MCA mini project. I've used Matplotlib library to create charts dynamically on runtime even creating PDF embedding those charts. Even the survey form is dynamic, admin will add question and that question will reflect over the page! (just like google forms). Backend database technology is SQLite3.
